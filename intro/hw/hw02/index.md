## Creating a webpage
Create your own personal webpage using HTML! Experiment with different tags, like headers, bulleted lists, and so on. You can search online for examples of how to do this. [This site](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp) may be helpful.

Include at least **five** of the following:
* Add a page title. This should go in the [head of your webpage](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp).
* A picture of yourself and/or an animal you identify with (you will probably want to put your image in the same folder as `index.html`).
* A web link to a recent project or assignment you've created.
* Numbered steps for a chocolate chip cookie recipe.
* A table of experimental results from a real or imaginary experiment.
* Embed a Youtube/Vimeo video (hint: clicking the share button will give you HTML embed code to include in your webpage).
* Embed a map from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap.
