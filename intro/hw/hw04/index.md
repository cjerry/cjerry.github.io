Do the problems in `hw04.py`. The assignment is self graded. To test
yourself, run the following on the command line:

```
$ python3 -m doctest hw04.py -v
```

If you passed the tests, you should see the following:

```
3 items passed all tests:
   3 tests in hw04.absval
   2 tests in hw04.hailstone
   3 tests in hw04.largest_factor
8 tests in 4 items.
8 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
```

If any tests fail, information about what exactly failed will be
displayed. To fix your problem, try testing things out in the interpreter!

If you experience any issues with grading, first make sure you are in the
correct folder. You may have to use `cd` to change directories, and use
`ls` to make sure the file is there.
