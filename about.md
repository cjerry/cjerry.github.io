My name is Jerry Chen, and I am a undergraduate studying electrical engineering
and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.

I'm passionate about tutoring and mentoring other students in computer science.
This Spring, I'm an undergraduate student instructor for
[CS61A](http://cs61a.org). I'm also the 61A course co-coordinator for the
[Computer Science Mentors](csmentors.berkeley.edu) group on campus.
