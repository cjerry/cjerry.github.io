## Building on GitHub Pages
So, something I didn't know about GitHub pages. It doesn't really support
custom Jekyll themes. Sure, there's the [list
here](https://pages.github.com/themes/) of officially supported themes. If
only I knew about them *before* I picked a theme...

Nevertheless, I tried to push my website with this custom theme. While
everything builds fine locally (I'm even using the GitHub Pages gem),
GitHub Pages would refuse to build my website with the theme. It's
supposed to work if you specify `remote_theme:` in `_config.yml`.

You'll never guess what happens.

What the heck is that?

## Changing to Travis CI
After spending a few hours on trying to fix all the build errors (it's
really annoying to debug over email as you might imagine), I didn't have
any patience left for trying to work around GitHub Pages. After looking at
some examples of other websites on GitHub, I decided to move to using
Travis CI.

### Changing branches
I pushed the website source onto a new "source" branch. "master" would be
reserved for just build products (the contents of `_site` essentially).
After that, setting up Travis CI was fairly straightforward.

## The Final Stretch
Are we done? Wait, Font Awesome isn't loading...

### Darn it
Oh yeah, GitHub will still try to build my web page using Jekyll so
`node_modules` is lost. Better include a `.nojekyll` file.

## Finished?
There's still a lot to do:
- Pagination is quite broken (though there are very few posts so
  whatever).
- Adding tags and categories for posts might be nice.
- The Travis build is extremely barebones at the moment.
- More automation for creating new posts and adding new CS 61A content
  would be a nice to have, but definitely not essential. Maybe look into
  `rake`?
- I should figure out something better than copying over my `node_modules`
  folder to the website.

However, I'm much happier with the new site compared to the old site. Not
bad for less than one week worth of effort!

## And of course, a summary
- Changing to Travis CI rather than depending on GitHub Pages to build
  everything definitely required some effort, but has made debugging a lot
  easier. Honestly though, getting started with Travis was a lot easier
  than I expected.
- Documentation for certain aspects of GitHub Pages and Jekyll is
  disappointingly scarce. Part of the reason I wrote all this down was for
  future me in case I ran into these issues again.
- Writing HTML still isn't fun. But Markdown is bearable.
