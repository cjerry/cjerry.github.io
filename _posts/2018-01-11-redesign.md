The starting point:
![before]({{ "/assets/posts/before.png" | absolute_url }})

Here's some problems I was having with my old website:
- I was tired of the aesthetic. The material design setup just felt out of
  place, and I wanted to go to something even simpler.
- The CSS was a mess. On top of importing two separate bootstrap
  libraries, I overlay a bunch of my own CSS on top. Starting fresh would
  be a good chance to clean this up.
- The color usage was inconsistent for key elements. Here's a list of the
  colors:
    - Teal for the hero (landing).
    - Blue for the navbar.
    - A different blue for one of the past semester CS 61A pages.
    - Black for an old navbar.
    - Another blue and red for the favicon.

I had a few goals in mind when planning this redesign (roughly in order of
decreasing priority):
- **An even simpler, more accessible student facing resource page.** This
  actually ended up not being too difficult. This would likely help with
  cleaning up the CSS mess. As an added "bonus", I would also be changing
  the aesthetic for the rest of the website.
- **Fewer, better pages.** This didn't mean having a one-pager website,
  but I felt like there were too many pages doing nothing. Also,
  collecting all the past CS 61A content into one page would be really
  nice.
- **Better automation.** This wasn't an initial goal, but ended up being
  something I decided to add partway into the design process.

## First Steps
I really liked the benefits of Jekyll for my site, so I wanted to keep
using it. The ability to write markdown as well as use a template engine
makes it really easy to avoid HTML, the worst part of web development (I'm
kidding about HTML, but only a little bit). As I would soon find out,
Jekyll + GitHub Pages still had a few unpleasant surprises in store.

I decided to look around for themes, and found that
[whiteglass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass) met my needs quite well.
Installing a Jekyll theme is super easy, and the process for customization
has been well thought out. The benefit of using a simple theme like
whiteglass is that it's really easy to add or remove page elements without
having them stick out like a sore thumb.

Adding my content and adjusting for this new theme went by mostly without
issues. There was a bit of a small learning curve in getting used to
working with templates, but nothing that I couldn't easily look up online.

Oh yeah. I guess pagination doesn't work. Look at this sadness:
```yaml
paginate: 9999 # TODO: pagination is broken
```

## Dark Theme?
I use dark theme for most of my code related things
(editors/terminals/etc.). I was curious how well this would translate to a
website, and experimented with it a bit at this point. But sadly, the
evidence seems to suggest that [dark text on a light background is more
visible](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/34925).

## Piling on the Imports
I needed to add Bootstrap and Font Awesome for some the page elements I
wanted to keep from the old website. The advice on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28737999/6469972) I found
suggests using Bower. So I did:
```bash
$ bower install bootstrap-sass
bower cached        https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass.git#3.3.7

... <lines omitted>

jquery#3.2.1 bower_components/jquery

   â•°â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•¯
```
Huh, guess I'd better update.
```bash
$ npm i -g bower
npm WARN deprecated bower@1.8.2: ...psst! Your project can stop working at any moment because its dependencies can change. Prevent this by migrating to Yarn: https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/

+ bower@1.8.2

```
Well, that doesn't sound good. What's a Yarn, anyways?

### Yarn and `node_modules`
As it turns out, Yarn isn't exactly a perfect replacement for Bower. This
seems pretty minor, but Yarn installs to `node_modules` instead of
`bower_components`. I happen to want to directly include these folders in
my final website (yes, building them on the fly is probably a better
idea). Why does this matter?

### A brief rant: Jekyll and default excludes
It turns out that Jekyll excludes `node_modules` by default. As of time of
writing, this doesn't appear to be documented anywhere (grumble grumble).

The only thing I could find was this [pull
request](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5210), where commenters
happily note that their builds have been sped up by this change. While
combining Jekyll with Yarn in this way might not have been standard, it
would have been really nice if this consequences of this change were
easier to find (ironically, someone even states that this change will
"solve a lot of user pains").

I can't even find anything about default excludes on the Jekyll website
anywhere. Sure, it's mentioned in the [changelog for
v3.3.0](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/history/#v3-3-0). But the page is
(perhaps rightfully) excluded from the website search as well as search
engine results.

In fact, the thing that tipped me off to this problem was [*GitHub's* own
help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing/),
which happens to mention:

> By default, Jekyll does not build any files or directories that
>
> - are hidden or used for backup (indicated by names that start with . or
        >   #, or that end with ~);
> - contain site content (indicated by names that start with \_); or
> - are excluded in the site configuration.

Note that this still conveniently doesn't mention `node_modules`. ðŸ™ƒ.

One last kicker: `_config.yml` offers an "include" option, which is
supposed to "force inclusion of directories and/or files". Guess what? It
doesn't work for `node_modules`.

## New Favicons
Ah, might as well. I initially used GIMP for pixel art, but decided to try
making an SVG this time around (since Safari requires an [SVG
image](https://yoast.com/dev-blog/safari-pinned-tab-icon-mask-icon/) for
the pinned tab icon). So far, so good.

For creating the actual favicon, I tried using
[realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net). This creates
the favicon easily enough. However, the favicon has to be scaled to many
different sizes, and the website does some really ugly interpolation for
simple favicons like mine.

![blurry favicon]({{ "/assets/posts/blurry-favicon.png" | absolute_url }})

I exported the different-sized bitmaps manually through GIMP. GIMP also
lets you create the
[`favicon.ico`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10819673/6469972) file which
combines many different sized icons.

## The next step
Ok, so everything has been prepped locally. `jekyll serve` seems to work
without issue. What could possibly go wrong when deploying to GitHub
pages?
