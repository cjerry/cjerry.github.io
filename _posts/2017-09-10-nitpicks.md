## On the topic of punctuation
* This is a hyphen: `-`
* This is a dash: `--`

Do not say "ls *dash* a" when you mean "ls *hyphen* a".

You can cheat this a bit when writing English sentences, but the command line is
usually much less forgiving.

I oftentimes say "hyphen hyphen" when I mean dash, since it seems like a lot of
people confuse the two. I dream of a world where I can confidently just say
"dash"...
