The standard terminal that comes with macOS and most Linux distros is fine
(by the way, Command Prompt for Windows is not). But why settle for fine, when you can get
something even better?

### A better Terminal.app
As I mention on my [setup page](/cs61a/setup), iTerm 2 is basically a better
version of the default macOS terminal. There's a whole host of nice features,
but the main reason I use iTerm 2 over Terminal.app is because of split panes.
Terminal.app only supports split panes of the same shell, whereas you can
basically have different shells (like new tabs) but in the same window with
iTerm 2. It sounds like a small thing, but it can make a fairly big difference
in terms of productivity for me.

### A better shell
You'll probably start with the [bash
shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) by default, which again
is fine. But stuff like Zsh (which I've tried) and Fish (which I haven't)
feature many small quality-of-life tweaks that make things easier. For Zsh,
there's the [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework
that makes it really easy to extend the functionality of zsh (much like
[configuring Vim, actually](/2017/08/22/configuration.html)).

### A better set of colors
Terminal starts with a black on white color scheme. It's fine.

I use the [Solarized Dark colorscheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
It's better (for me at least). There's a million different color schemes out
there, and installation is generally pretty easy so you can play around with a
couple.
