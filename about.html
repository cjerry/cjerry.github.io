<p>Hi there! I'm an undergraduate studying electrical
engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<p>This Spring, I'm an undergraduate student instructor for
<a href="http://cs61a.org">CS61A</a>.
I'm also the 61A course co-coordinator for the <a
  href="csmentors.berkeley.edu">Computer Science Mentors</a> group on campus.
