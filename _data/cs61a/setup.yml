editors:
  - name: Neovim
    info:
      - Neovim is the future of Vim. It comes with some sane defaults and
        extends default Vim functionality to make it better. Here's why you
        should use Vim at all.
      - Fun fact - Vim is a clone of Vi, which was
        written by Berkeley alum and programming superstar Bill Joy.
      - <b>Pros:</b> Fast and addictive. Feature rich, but you only need to
        learn a minimal amount to become productive. You'll also look cool doing
        it. ðŸ™ƒ
      - <b>Cons:</b> Steep learning curve. Customization is required to unlock
        many nice features that are default in other editors.

  - name: Atom
    info:
      - With a built in package manager, Atom is incredibly easy to customize
        (like the extension manager for your favorite web browser, but arguably
        better).
        On top of that, sensible default packages are installed as well!
      - <b>Pros:</b> Easy to use and customize.
      - <b>Cons:</b> In the editor world, Atom is relatively new. There are
        still some bugs that need to be sorted out, and many packages could use
        significant improvement.

terminals:
  - name: iTerm2
    info:
      - As far as I'm concerned, this is basically a better version of terminal
        that ships with macOS.
      - <b>Pros:</b> Just look at this <a
        href="https://www.iterm2.com/features.html">beautiful list of
        features</a>.
      - <b>Cons:</b> macOS only.

  - name: Babun
    info:
      - Babun is probably the best Windows shell I've used. It comes built in
        with <a href="http://ohmyz.sh/">oh my zsh</a> (z shell) which is usually
        a bit of a hassle to install on Windows.
      - <b>Pros:</b> Comes built in with a package manager which beats whatever
        mess Cygwin and GitBash have.
      - <b>Cons:</b> There are some potentially annoying defaults that you have
        to manually disable (for example, a self-check on startup). And... it
        still uses Mintty, which means no tabs, minimal window configuration,
        etc.

misc:
  - name: Homebrew
    info:
      - Package manager for macOS. In a nutshell, package managers make it easy
        for developers to install software and keep it up to date. Lots of
        command line applications are installable through Homebrew, and Homebrew
        Cask allows you to install macOS applications as well!

  - name: Chocolatey
    info:
      - For the sake of completeness, here's a package manager for Windows. I've
        never used it, however.

  - name: Oh My Zsh
    info:
      - Replace the default shell with Zsh, extended with many useful plugins.
        Highly customizable and features some pretty nifty themes as well.
      - Oh My Zsh is installable on Windows, but it requires some extra details.

  - name: Git
    info:
      - Git is a version control system which basically lets you save snapshots
        of your code.
      - The real beauty of Git is that it allows you to fearlessly experiment
        with new ideas. It might take a while to learn, but it will only be more
        prevalent later on in school & work!
